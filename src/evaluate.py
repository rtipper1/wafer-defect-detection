# Task 4: Evaluate ViT

#  Calculate F1-score
#  Create confusion matrix
#  Document results

# Load trained model from checkpoint
# Run inference on test set (no gradients)
# Calculate metrics (F1, precision, recall, accuracy)
# Generate confusion matrix
# Save results

# This is critical for your presentation - you need these metrics to show your model works!
